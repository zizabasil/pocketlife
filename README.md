# Pocket Life

Welcome to your daily dose of inspiration and reflection! This app brings you a new Bible verse each day that you can reflect, easily set as a favorite or share with friends. 

You can also jot down your thoughts in the built-in journal, complete with mood tracking to help you see how you’ve been feeling over time. 

Got prayers? 
You can create, edit, and update your prayers. Easily mark them as answered or pending whenever you like. 

Looking for a little extra motivation? 
You can also explore and take on meaningful challenges, whether it’s about improving your habits, deepening your faith, or caring for your well-being. Just pick a challenge that speaks to you and track your progress along the way. It’s a great way to stay focused and feel accomplished, one small step at a time. 

Need a little nudge? 
Set reminders for daily verse, prayer time, journaling and challenges so you never miss a moment. Plus, you’ll get helpful notifications to keep you on track. You can even check out your mood in a pie chart and track your prayer status with a handy bar chart. 

It’s a simple, personal space to grow in faith and stay connected.
